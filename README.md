How to Install Linux on Windows 10
Linux is a family of open-source operating systems. They are based on the Linux kernel and are free to download. They can be installed on either a Mac or Windows computer. Here’s how to install Linux on a Windows 10 PC. 

If you want to dual boot Linux and Windows, you will need to create a space for your Linux OS to live. In order to do this, you will have to partition your main hard drive. Here’s how to do that:

Finally, click Shrink.
Once you have a designated space to install Linux, you’ll need to write a Linux Distro onto a USB thumb drive or external drive 4GB or larger. Here’s how to do that:

How to Make a Linux Bootable USB
***Download a Linux distro in ISO format. An ISO file is a disk image. Some of the top options are Ubuntu, Mint, or Fedora. They are free to download from each distribution’s main website. For this article, we are using Ubuntu.
Insert the USB drive into your computer. You might be asked to format your drive. This will erase all the data stored on your drive, so make sure to back up your files before you begin.
Download Rufus. You can find the latest version of the application here.
Open Rufus and select your USB drive from the Device list. If you don’t know which drive to use, eject all other drives until you only have one to choose from.
Under Boot Selection, click the Select button and choose the ISO file you downloaded earlier. Don’t change the other default settings.

Finally, click Start. If you get a pop-up message asking you to select a mode that you want to use to write the image, choose ISO.

Then wait for Rufus to mount your ISO file onto your drive. This might take some time, so be patient if the progress bar gets stuck.***

Warning: This will erase all the data on your drive, so make sure to back up any important files.

Your computer will now boot Linux. If your computer reboots Windows, there was either an issue with your drive, or you might have to change settings in your BIOS.
Warning: Changing BIOS settings can damage your computer if you don’t know what you’re doing.

Select Install Linux. Some distros also let you try out the OS before installing it here.

Go through the installation process. This will differ depending on which distro you are trying to install. These details might include your WiFi network, language, time zone, keyboard layout, etc. You might also be required to create an account with a username and password. Make sure to write down any details, as you will likely need them in the future.
Most distros will allow you to partition your drive or erase it and do a clean install during the installation.
Warning: Erasing your disk will mean you will lose your settings, files, and Windows operating system. Only select Erase if you have saved copies of all your files before starting the install process.

Reboot your computer when prompted. If you have more than one OS in your system, you will be taken to a GNU GRUB screen after rebooting. This screen allows you to select which OS you want to boot. 
ubuntu grub
If you do not see a GRUB screen when you boot up your computer, you can try moving your Linux distro higher on your boot list in BIOS.

When you’re done, you can do a hardware check. In some cases, you may need to download additional drivers to make some hardware work. The option to download drivers can be found in the Systems Settings of your new Linux OS. After verifying that your hardware is working properly, you can start exploring and using your Linux distro.
